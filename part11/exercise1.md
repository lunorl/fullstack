I have decided to write this text on using django. For my linting tool I think it would be a good idea to use pylint. I believe that there are some specific linting projets for django such as django-lint. Django documentation tells us that the unittest module is ideal for testing django code. I believe that building is pretty simple with the django built in building features. Apparently it is possible to use a platform called DigitalOcean to setup CI that is simpler than Jenkins or Github actions. Circle CI also seems like a pretty simple alternative. There is also Gitlab which should be pretty similar to the github way of doing things. I believe that in the vast majority of cases a cloud-based environment would be good enough. Of course if we were really trying to build at scale we should try to use a self-hosted system since it would be less expensive, but most projects will probably be a lot easier to develop with github actions, which would be a lot simpler to set up than something like jenkins. Although if someone was trying to build something more open source it would probably be better to use jenkins.
